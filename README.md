# Timer Program

This Python program functions as a timer with the following features:

1. Countdown Timer
2. Stopwatch
3. User Interface
4. Accuracy

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**: Start a countdown timer for a specified duration.
- **Stopwatch**: Start and stop a stopwatch to measure elapsed time.
- **User Interface**: Simple text-based menu for user interaction.
- **Accuracy**: Uses the `time` module for accurate time measurements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/timer-program.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd timer-program
    ```

## Usage

To run the Timer program:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python timer.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to interact with the timer functionalities.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Timer program:

```plaintext
Timer Menu:
1. Start Stopwatch
2. Stop Stopwatch
3. Start Countdown
4. Exit

Enter your choice: 1
Stopwatch started.

Enter your choice: 2
Stopwatch stopped. Elapsed time: 5.27 seconds.

Enter your choice: 3
Enter countdown duration in seconds: 10
Countdown started for 10 seconds.
Countdown finished.

Enter your choice: 4
Exiting...
```

## Script Overview

The Timer program consists of two classes:

### Timer Class

This class handles the timer functionalities, including starting and stopping a stopwatch and running a countdown.

- **Attributes**:
  - `start_time`: Stores the start time when the stopwatch is started.
  - `end_time`: Stores the end time when the stopwatch is stopped.
  - `is_running`: Indicates whether the stopwatch is currently running.

- **Methods**:
  - `start_stopwatch()`: Starts the stopwatch.
  - `stop_stopwatch()`: Stops the stopwatch and calculates the elapsed time.
  - `start_countdown(duration)`: Starts a countdown timer for the specified duration.

### UserInterface Class

This class provides a simple text-based user interface to interact with the timer functionalities.

- **Methods**:
  - `display_menu()`: Displays the menu options for the user.
  - `run()`: Runs the main loop to handle user input and execute corresponding actions.

## Customization

You can customize the Timer program by modifying the following aspects:

- **User Interface**: Modify the text-based menu or add additional options.
- **Timer Functionalities**: Extend the Timer class to include additional functionalities such as lap timing or multiple countdowns.
